# JackIn

JackIn is a small command line tool that allows you to bring the output of a (virtual) sound device into jack. It was primarily written for macOS but might also be compatible with other platforms.

JackIn won't create it's own sound card, but it can be used in conjunction with tools like [Ultraschall Hub](https://github.com/Ultraschall/ultraschall-hub) or [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower).
If you are looking for a one stop solution you might want to check out [JackBridge](https://github.com/madhatter68/JackRouter) instead.
